We will be using avr gcc compiler to build and execute the code. The code describes how the led will respond as per the status of the switch. If the switch is on, the LED will glow, if it is off the LED will not glow. For safety, we have activated the pull-up resistor of the input pin, so that if the status of the switch is floating, it will counter the problem. This is how we execute the code.
